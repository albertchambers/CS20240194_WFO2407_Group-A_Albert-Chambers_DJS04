# DJS04: Book Connect - Web Component Transformation

## Objective

Transform the book preview functionality of the "Book Connect" application into a fully operational Web Component. Additionally, evaluate and potentially convert other parts of the application into Web Components to enhance modularity and reusability.

## Goals

1. **Convert Book Preview to Web Component:**

   - Encapsulate the book preview feature into a Web Component, making it reusable and independent.

2. **Assess Other Components:**

   - Identify other elements within the "Book Connect" app that could benefit from being converted into Web Components.

3. **Maintain Functionality:**
   - Ensure that the application retains all its current functionalities after refactoring.

## Tasks

### 1. Understand the Existing Codebase

- Familiarise yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.

### 2. Create a Web Component for Book Preview

- **Encapsulation:**
  - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
- **Self-contained Design:**

  - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Testing:**
  - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.

### 3. Identify and Convert Other Components

- **Analysis:**
  - Analyse the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
- **Prioritization:**

  - Prioritise components based on their reusability and importance to the app.

- **Conversion:**
  - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.

### 4. Testing and Integration

- **Individual Testing:**
  - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
- **User Experience:**
  - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.

## Documentation

- **Process Documentation:**
  - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
- **Challenges Faced:**

  - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.

- **Usage Guide:**
  - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.
